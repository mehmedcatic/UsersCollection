# UsersCollection
 
UsersCollection

This is a small JavaScript project which uses two external public APIs.
-	To get user pictures: https://tinyfac.es/api/users
-	To get user data: http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

Check this link for more info: http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

The idea was to demonstrate usage of an API throughout the project. 
We can also POST a new user locally with the data from inputs.
